3. Copy it to `custom_components/color_temperature_light_mixer/` in your Home Assistant configuration directory
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Initial Setup

After installation, add the integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "Color Temperature Light Mixer"
4. Follow the configuration steps:

### Step 1: Connection Information

Enter the required connection details:

- **Host/IP Address:** The hostname or IP address of your device/service
- **API Key/Token:** Your authentication credentials (if applicable)
- **Port:** Connection port (default: 8080)

Click **Submit** to test the connection.

### Step 2: Configuration Options

Configure optional settings:

- **Update Interval:** How often to poll for updates (default: 5 minutes)
- **Name:** Friendly name for this integration instance

Click **Submit** to complete setup.

## What Gets Created

After successful setup, the integration creates:

### Devices

- **Device Name:** Main device representing your connected service/hardware
  - Model information
  - Software version
  - Configuration URL (link to device web interface)

### Entities

The following entities are automatically created:

#### Sensors

- `sensor.<device_name>_<sensor_name>` - Descriptive sensor measurements
- More sensors as applicable to your setup

#### Binary Sensors

- `binary_sensor.<device_name>_<sensor_name>` - On/off status indicators

#### Switches

- `switch.<device_name>_<switch_name>` - Controllable on/off switches

#### Other Platforms

Additional entities may be created depending on your device capabilities.

## First Steps

### Dashboard Cards

Add entities to your dashboard:

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Click **Edit Dashboard** → **Add Card**
3. Choose card type (e.g., "Entities", "Glance")
4. Select entities from "Color Temperature Light Mixer"

Example entities card:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Color Temperature Light Mixer
entities:
  - sensor.device_name_sensor
  - binary_sensor.device_name_connectivity
  - switch.device_name_switch
```

### Automations

Use the integration in automations:

**Example - Trigger on sensor change:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "React to sensor value"
    trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.device_name_sensor
    action:
      - action: notify.notify
        data:
          message: "Sensor changed to {{ trigger.to_state.state }}"
```

**Example - Control switch based on time:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on in morning"
    trigger:
      - trigger: time
        at: "07:00:00"
    action:
      - action: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.device_name_switch
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If setup fails with connection errors:

1. Verify the host/IP address is correct and reachable
2. Check that the API key/token is valid
3. Ensure no firewall is blocking the connection
4. Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages

### Entities Not Updating

If entities show "Unavailable" or don't update:

1. Check that the device/service is online
2. Verify API credentials haven't expired
3. Review logs: **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
4. Try reloading the integration

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.color_temperature_light_mixer: debug
```

Add this to `configuration.yaml`, restart, and reproduce the issue. Check logs for detailed information.
