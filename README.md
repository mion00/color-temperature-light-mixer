2. Find **Color Temperature Light Mixer**
3. Click the **3 dots menu** → **Reconfigure**
4. Enter new username/password
5. Click Submit

#### Connection Status

Monitor your connection status with the **API Connection** binary sensor:

- **On** (Connected): Integration is receiving data normally
- **Off** (Disconnected): Connection lost or authentication failed
  - Check the binary sensor attributes for diagnostic information
  - Verify credentials if authentication failed
  - Check network connectivity

### Enable Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for this integration, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.color_temperature_light_mixer: debug
```

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Errors

If you receive authentication errors:

1. Verify your username and password are correct
2. Check that your account has the necessary permissions
3. Wait for the automatic reauthentication prompt, or manually reconfigure
4. Check the API Connection binary sensor for status

#### Device Not Responding

If your device is not responding:

1. Check the **API Connection** binary sensor - it should be "On"
2. Check your network connection
3. Verify the device is powered on
4. Check the integration diagnostics (Settings → Devices & Services → Color Temperature Light Mixer → 3 dots → Download diagnostics)

- **VS Code** with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- **Git** — macOS and Linux usually have it already; see below if not, or to get a newer version:
  - **🍎 macOS:** The system Git (`xcode-select --install`) works fine. Recommended: `brew install git` ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)) for a current version.
  - **🐧 Linux:** Usually pre-installed. If not: `sudo apt install git` (or your distro's equivalent).
  - **🪟 Windows + WSL2 ⭐:** Install Git _inside WSL2_ with `sudo apt install git`. Git on Windows itself is not needed — VS Code clones and operates entirely within WSL2.
  - **🪟 Windows + Docker Desktop:** Install via `winget install Git.Git` or download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- **Hardware** — the devcontainer runs a full Home Assistant instance including Python tooling:

  |          | Minimum    | Recommended                           |
  | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | **RAM**  | 8 GB       | 16 GB or more                         |
  | **CPU**  | 4 cores    | 8 cores or more                       |
  | **Disk** | 10 GB free | 20 GB free (SSD strongly recommended) |

> [!TIP]
> **Not sure which Docker option to pick?** Start with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) — it works on all platforms, has a GUI, and needs no extra setup. The ⭐ options are faster alternatives once you're comfortable. macOS and Linux offer the best devcontainer experience — containers run with no extra VM layer and file I/O is fast. Windows works well too; this integration uses named container volumes (files live inside WSL2, not on the Windows drive) to keep performance acceptable.

> [!NOTE]
> **New to Dev Containers?** See the [VS Code Dev Containers documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_system-requirements) for system requirements and how to install the extension. **Once the extension is installed, you're done** — this repository already ships a complete devcontainer configuration. You don't need to follow the rest of the VS Code guide; the setup steps below are all that's needed.

#### Setup Steps

1. **Clone in a Dev Container:**

   **🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux:** Clone the repository and open the folder in VS Code → click **"Reopen in Container"** when prompted (or `F1` → **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**).

   **🪟 Windows:** In VS Code, press `F1` → **"Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Named Container Volume..."** and enter the repository URL. This keeps files inside WSL2 for best I/O performance.

2. Wait for the container to build (2-3 minutes first time)

3. **Review and commit** changes in Source Control (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)

4. **Start developing**:

   ```bash
   script/develop  # Home Assistant runs at http://localhost:8123
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> Both Codespaces and local DevContainer provide the exact same experience. The only difference is where the container runs (GitHub's cloud vs. your machine).

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

> [!NOTE]
> **Transparency Notice:** This integration was developed with assistance from AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude, and others). While the codebase follows Home Assistant Core standards, AI-generated code may not be reviewed or tested to the same extent as manually written code. AI tools were used to generate boilerplate code, implement standard integration features (config flow, coordinator, entities), ensure code quality and type safety, and write documentation. If you encounter unexpected behavior, please [open an issue](../../issues) on GitHub.
>
> _This section can be removed or modified if AI assistance was not used in your integration's development._
