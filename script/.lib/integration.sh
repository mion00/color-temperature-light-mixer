# Exported variables (available after sourcing):
#   INTEGRATION_DOMAIN  — e.g. "my_integration"
#   INTEGRATION_PATH    — e.g. "custom_components/my_integration"
#
# Override by setting INTEGRATION_DOMAIN before sourcing:
#   INTEGRATION_DOMAIN=my_integration source script/.lib/integration.sh

# _detect_integration_domain: scan custom_components/ and return the first
# real (non-symlink) directory that contains a manifest.json.
#
# HACS-installed integrations are symlinks created by script/setup/sync-hacs
# (custom_components/<name> → ../../config/custom_components/<name>), so
# excluding symlinks reliably isolates the blueprint's own integration.
